# Need TensorFlow 1.0.1, either in virtualenv (must be in dl/)
# to run the training code or coming with the system.
# To check TensorFlow version, use:
python -c 'import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)'  # for Python 2

# also install the following packages in the environment
# if need to run the input generator again using:
sudo pip install scikit-image
sudo pip install SimpleITK

# Run the controller: _ctl2.sh which will alternatively train and evaluate after
# certain number of steps. In this controller, it assume the correct TensorFlow
# version is in the virtualenv, which is activated by "source ${TF}",
# you can find it in _ctl2.sh. Run the controller using this command:
bash ~/dl/code/_ctl2.sh

# You can see the TensorBoard of the currently running code using this command:
tensorboard --logdir=~/dl/BRATS2015/tumor_cropped/

# Note: The code is magical. This magic makes sense. If running into any errors,
# please think carefully first before changing the code.
